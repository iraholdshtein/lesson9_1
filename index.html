                    <p>his happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr.Fogg was travveling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve
                         thousend head of buffalo <br> encumbered the track. the locomotiv, slakening its speed, tried to clear the way with 
                         its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along wiyh a tranquil gait, uttering
                          now and then deafening<br>bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction,
                           nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent <br> of living flesh wich no dam could contain. </p><br>

                        seat, and waited philosophically unit it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.,<br>
                        Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them. </p><br>

                        know if Mr.Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engeneer who doesn't dare to run the locomotiv into this herd of beasts!"<br><br>
